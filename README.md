# Experience Engineering Full Stack Grade Ladder

The aim of this document is to help the team understand the different technical skills that each developer needs to have at each grade. 

This grade ladder will not replace the [existing one](https://capgemini.github.io/grade-ladder/) but will enhance it, focusing mainly on the **technical skills** for a full stack JavaScript developer.

## Grade:
